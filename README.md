## 2. How to Run This Code
(1) You need to download the csv files named **clean_users.csv** and **trainingfinal.csv**.
(2) Download the helper code from https://github.com/TianhongBu/GetOldTweets-python which I forked to this repository as well.
You wouldn't be having much trouble running this notebook now.
